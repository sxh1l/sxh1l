👋 Hi, I’m Sahil Datta (@sxh1l)

I’m a BCA student (MSc IT ongoing) who enjoys building things, fixing problems,  
and learning by doing.

I’m currently focused on frontend development and gradually exploring  
automation, system thinking, and practical tooling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 What I work with
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- React  
- Frontend development  
- Debugging & improving existing code  
- AI-assisted development (as a tool, not a crutch)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌱 Currently learning
- Better frontend architecture  
- Automation workflows  
- How to build calmer, more reliable user experiences  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ How I like to work 
- Clear outcomes over buzzwords  
- Small improvements that compound  
- Tools should reduce friction, not add it
